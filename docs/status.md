# Project Status

## Current Phase

Phase 2 — Solution Scaffolding (NOT STARTED)

## Task Tracker

### Phase 1 — Problem Mapping (COMPLETE)
- [x] Create standard PDLC mapping document
- [x] Create Mermaid visualization charts
- [x] Create AI impact analysis document
- [x] Set up GitHub repo and push artifacts
- [x] Adapt starter kit workflow to this project
- [x] Organize docs folder (baseline/, references/, planning/)
- [x] Copy brownfield SWE process + project workflow as reference docs

### Phase 2 — Solution Scaffolding (TODO)
- [ ] Scaffold solution: AI-assisted code review
- [ ] Scaffold solution: AI-generated test plans & QA acceleration
- [ ] Scaffold solution: Metrics-based staging
- [ ] Scaffold solution: Incremental delivery
- [ ] Scaffold solution: Parallel workflows
- [ ] Scaffold solution: AI as PDLC participant
- [ ] Create solution overview document
- [ ] Identify solution interdependencies

### Phase 3 — Group Session Prep (TODO)
- [ ] Discussion guide / agenda
- [ ] Current state vs. future state framework
- [ ] Debate topics from solution scaffolds
- [ ] Prioritization exercise
- [ ] Package for sharing

### Phase 4 — Solution Deep Dives (TODO)
*Tasks TBD after group input*

### Phase 5 — Prototype & Pilot Design (TODO)
*Tasks TBD after Phase 4*

### Phase 6 — Test, Learn, Iterate (TODO)
*Tasks TBD after Phase 5*

## Session Log

### Session 1 — 2026-02-18 (Opus, Planning + Build)
- Discussed the core problem: AI collapsed build time but PDLC didn't adapt
- Created 3 baseline documents (PDLC mapping, Mermaid charts, AI impact analysis)
- Set up GitHub repo: https://github.com/emersonmccuin-pixel/PDLC-in-the-Age-of-AI
- Adapted claude-code-starter-kit workflow for this project
- Created CLAUDE.md, plan.md, status.md
- Phase 1 complete. Ready for Phase 2 in next session.
- Organized docs: baseline/ for Phase 1 output, references/ for external process docs, planning/ for phase work
- Copied brownfield SWE process and project workflow as reference material for the group
- Analyzed both reference docs against the 9-phase PDLC — identified that both cover phases 1-4 well but phases 5-9 (review, QA, staging, deploy, feedback) are blank spots
- Key insight: brownfield process is team-aware but AI-naive past build; project workflow is AI-aware but team-naive. AI-native PDLC needs to be both.
- Identified three-layer model for universality: Principles (universal) → Patterns (platform-agnostic) → Implementations (org-specific)
- Decision: pause before Phase 2 scaffolding to incorporate new foundational material

### Before Next Session
- Read `docs/full-pdlc-ai-native-brief.md` — new foundational input from Emerson
- Restructure Phase 2 plan around the three-layer model (principles → patterns → implementations)
- Incorporate gap analysis findings into the scaffold structure
