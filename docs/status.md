### Phase 6 — Test, Learn, Iterate (TODO)
*Tasks TBD after Phase 5*

## Session Log

### Session 1 — 2026-02-18 (Opus, Planning + Build)
- Discussed the core problem: AI collapsed build time but PDLC didn't adapt
- Created 3 baseline documents (PDLC mapping, Mermaid charts, AI impact analysis)
- Set up GitHub repo: https://github.com/emersonmccuin-pixel/PDLC-in-the-Age-of-AI
- Adapted claude-code-starter-kit workflow for this project
- Created CLAUDE.md, plan.md, status.md
- Phase 1 complete. Ready for Phase 2 in next session.
